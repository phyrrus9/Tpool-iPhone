//Tpool-iPhone project. I don't know really how much of this //
//will be kept up-to-date but it is worth while to mess with //
//it a little bit if you want to. This must be build from the//
//command-line using 'make' because otherwise it will build a//
//non-signed .app GUI file (which will crash due to lack of a//
//appdelegate). I just fetch the binary file and chmod it ...//
//This code is distributed in the hope that it will be useful//
//to somebody, this code comes with no warranty, it is uo to //
//the programmer to ensure the safety of the user for whom he//
//is writing code using this library for This library is open//
//source in all ways, meaning there is absolutely no lisence //
//agreement accompanied with it, though I would be happy if  //
//this comment block was left in the code. Feel free to add  //
//your name under mine if you like but please leave my coment//
//block intact (with any modifications you wish to perform)..//
